To deal with multiple files in JS, we use import and export properties to transfer code across files.

Import and Export can be of entire file, or just functions as well.
1. Files: 
```js
import "path.extension";
```

2. Functions: 
```js
import function_name from "path";


export default function_name;
```

- Note: Files doesn't require export calls.
