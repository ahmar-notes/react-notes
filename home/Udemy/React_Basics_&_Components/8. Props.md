Arguments passed into components, providing access to custom data.

```jsx
const myElement = <Car brand="Ford" />;
```

```jsx
function Car(props) {
	return <h2>I am a {props.band}! </h2>
}
```
```jsx
// Some refinements
// Can be written in short
function Car({ band }) {
	return <h2>I am a {band}! </h2>
}

// This will work if `band` prop is not passed when Car is called.
function Car({ band = 'myBand' }) {
	return <h2>I am a {band}! </h2>
}
```

### What can be passed as props?
1. Variables - number, boolean, object, string.
2. Function
3. JSX
4. Components or called component

### How React makes props available to child?
React automatically constructs an object based on prop names and values. This object is made available to the child as the first parameter.

### When to use props?
1. Technically - props are used to send data downwards (i.e. parent to child in the UI tree).
2. Practically - props of a component determine the variations of the components. e.g background-color, text, boolean props etc.
