<h2>What?</h2>
React is a JavaScript library to build UI in a <u>declarative way</u>.

<h2>Why?</h2>
The declarative way of React is that we only needs to specify the future state of a code, and React automatically figure out the required DOM manipulations to achieve that state from the initial state.

Whereas in Vanilla JS, we need to specify every steps of DOM manipulation to achieve a particular state (Imperative way).

Easy to go syntax,  less mental strain as of Imperative nature.

<h2>How?</h2>
React lets us define HTML and JS fused code called as <strong>JSX (JavaScript XML)</strong> in .js files. And hence we are able to specify the required state in HTML format. 
At the backstage, React also converts JSX into JS code, and carries out all the possible DOM manipulation required to achieve the required state.
